In these difficult times of covid-19, we all were getting
bored in our houses due to lockdown so we decided to take
up this project as this will not only enhance our skills but
also provide us with something fun and entertaining to do.
We developed a multi-level kart racing game with Unity
3D platform and successfully hosted it through the Unity
WebGL platform so that everyone could play and enjoy our
masterpiece.
